## Troubleshooting

### "Composer not found"
- Install Composer using the instructions above
- Make sure it's in your PATH

### "Google Drive credentials not found"
- Ensure `credentials/service-account-key.json` exists
- Check file permissions (should be 600)

### "Upload failed"
- Check PHP error logs
- Verify Google Drive API is enabled
- Ensure service account has access to the folder

### "File too large"
- Check `MAX_FILE_SIZE` in `config.php`
- Verify server upload limits in `.htaccess`

## Security Notes

- Keep your service account key secure
- Never commit `credentials/` folder to version control
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regularly update dependencies
